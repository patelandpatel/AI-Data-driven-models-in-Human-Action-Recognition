# AI-Data-driven-models-in-Human-Action-Recognition
The main task is building a video classification system to perform a human action recognition system.Use a convolutional network (CNN) to extract the spatial features, and LSTM is used to identify temporal relations between frames. We get 84% accuracy in detecting the hitting children themselves.
